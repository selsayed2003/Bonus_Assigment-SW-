Getting Started
Follow these instructions to build and run the Docker container and access the API documentation.

1. Building and Running the Docker Container
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-ssh-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Step 2: Build the Docker Image
Run the following command to build the Docker image:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t node-book-api .
Step 3: Run the Docker Container
Run the container using:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 5000:5000 node-book-api
-p 5000:5000: Maps port 5000 in the container to port 5000 on your machine.
The API will now be accessible at http://localhost:5000.
Step 4: Test the API
Once the container is running, test the API using your browser, Postman, or curl.

Example:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:5000/list
2. Accessing the Swagger API Documentation
Swagger UI provides interactive API documentation where you can test API endpoints.

Step 1: Navigate to Swagger Documentation
Open your browser and go to:

bash
Copy code
http://localhost:5000/api-docs
Step 2: Explore and Test API Endpoints
Use the Swagger interface to interactively test all API endpoints.
Example endpoints:
